##  Role-Based Access Control

BigML API keys grant access to resources but  managing user roles and permissions at the account level is equally important.

## Recommendations

- Create separate accounts or projects for different users or teams if possible.
- Limit user permissions based on job functions, and only provide write access to trusted developers.
- Audit access logs regularly to detect unusual or suspicious activity.
- If your organization integrates BigML with identity providers supporting Single Sign-On (SSO), leverage this for centralized access control.
